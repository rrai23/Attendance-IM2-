## ðŸ”§ Employees Tab Fix Summary

### Problem Identified
The employees tab was broken due to improper async initialization in the JavaScript constructor.

### Root Cause
- The `EmployeesPageManager` constructor was calling `this.init()` directly
- `init()` is an async method that returns a Promise
- When called from a constructor, the Promise was not being awaited
- This caused initialization to fail silently without proper error handling

### Solution Applied
1. **Modified Constructor**: Removed the automatic call to `this.init()` from the constructor
2. **Updated HTML Initialization**: Changed the DOMContentLoaded event handler to properly await the initialization
3. **Added Error Handling**: Added proper try/catch with user-visible error messages

### Files Modified
- `js/employees-page.js` - Fixed constructor
- `employees.html` - Fixed initialization script

### Expected Result
- Employees page should now load properly
- Employee table should populate with data
- All CRUD functionality (Add, Edit, View, Delete) should work
- Error messages will be displayed if initialization fails

### Test Steps
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5500/employees.html
2. Verify that the employee table loads with data
3. Test the "Add Employee" button functionality
4. Test filtering and search features
5. Test view/edit/delete actions on existing employees

The fix ensures proper async/await handling for the page initialization, which should resolve the "broken" state of the employees tab.
