# Employee Management Table Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Employee Names Showing as "undefined"
**Problem**: The table was displaying `undefined` for employee names in attendance records.
**Root Cause**: Attendance records from the unified data service didn't include the `employeeName` field.
**Fix**: 
- Enhanced the `renderTable()` method to look up employee names from the employees array
- Added fallback logic to populate missing employee data in attendance records
- Updated filter logic to handle missing employee names

### 2. Employee IDs Showing as Numbers Instead of Codes
**Problem**: Employee IDs were showing as `1` instead of `emp_001` format.
**Root Cause**: Attendance records only contained numeric IDs, not formatted employee codes.
**Fix**:
- Added logic to generate proper employee codes in format `emp_XXX`
- Enhanced employee lookup to use multiple possible code fields
- Added fallback code generation for missing employee codes

### 3. Duplicate renderTable Methods
**Problem**: There were two `renderTable()` methods causing conflicts.
**Root Cause**: Code duplication from previous merges or edits.
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate method and related duplicate functions

### 4. Missing Employee Data Population
**Problem**: Attendance records lacked complete employee information.
**Fix**: Added data enrichment logic to populate missing employee details from the employees array

## Code Changes Made

### Enhanced renderTable() Method
```javascript
renderTable() {
    // ...existing code...
    tbody.innerHTML = this.filteredData.map(record => {
        // Find the employee details from the employees array
        const employee = this.employees.find(emp => emp.id == record.employeeId);
        const employeeName = record.employeeName || (employee ? employee.name : `Employee ${record.employeeId}`);
        const employeeCode = record.employeeCode || (employee ? (employee.employeeId || employee.code || `emp_${String(record.employeeId).padStart(3, '0')}`) : `emp_${String(record.employeeId).padStart(3, '0')}`);
        const department = record.department || (employee ? employee.department : '');
        
        return `...template with proper employee data...`;
    }).join('');
}
```

### Enhanced Data Loading
```javascript
// Ensure attendance records have employee names populated
this.attendanceData = this.attendanceData.map(record => {
    if (!record.employeeName) {
        const employee = this.employees.find(emp => emp.id == record.employeeId);
        if (employee) {
            record.employeeName = employee.name || employee.fullName || `Employee ${record.employeeId}`;
            record.employeeCode = employee.employeeId || employee.code || `emp_${String(record.employeeId).padStart(3, '0')}`;
            record.department = employee.department || '';
        }
    }
    return record;
});
```

### Enhanced Filter Logic
```javascript
if (search) {
    // Look up employee name from employees array if not in record
    const employee = this.employees.find(emp => emp.id == record.employeeId);
    const employeeName = record.employeeName || (employee ? (employee.name || employee.fullName) : `Employee ${record.employeeId}`);
    
    if (!employeeName.toLowerCase().includes(search)) {
        matches = false;
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Dropdown Population
```javascript
this.employees.forEach(emp => {
    const empName = emp.name || emp.fullName || `Employee ${emp.id}`;
    const option = new Option(empName, emp.id);
    // ...add to dropdown...
});
```

## Debug Features Added
- Added logging of sample employee and attendance data structures
- Added console output showing data loading progress
- Enhanced error messages with data structure information

## Expected Results
1. **Employee Names**: Should now display proper names instead of "undefined"
2. **Employee Codes**: Should display as `emp_001`, `emp_002`, etc. instead of just numbers
3. **Department Info**: Should display department information where available
4. **Search Functionality**: Should work properly with employee names
5. **Dropdowns**: Should populate with correct employee names

## Files Modified
- `employee-management.html`: Enhanced table rendering and data handling logic

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Table displays employee names correctly
- [ ] Employee IDs show as `emp_XXX` format
- [ ] Search functionality works with employee names
- [ ] Employee dropdowns populate correctly
- [ ] All CRUD operations work with proper employee data
- [ ] Console shows proper data structure logging
