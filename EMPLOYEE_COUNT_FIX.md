# Employee Count Inconsistency Fix

## Problem Identified
The dashboard was showing 6 employees while other parts of the system (employee page, analytics, payroll) were showing only 5 employees.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `data-service.js` file in the `getEmployees()` method. The method had a filter that only included users with roles 'employee' or 'admin', but excluded users with role 'manager'.

### Mock Data Structure:
- **6 total users in the system:**
  1. John Administrator (role: 'admin')
  2. Maria Garcia (role: 'manager') ← **This was being excluded!**
  3. David Chen (role: 'employee')
  4. Samantha Patel (role: 'employee')
  5. Robert Johnson (role: 'employee')
  6. Lisa Martinez (role: 'employee')

### Previous Filter Logic:
```javascript
.filter(emp => emp.role === 'employee' || emp.role === 'admin')
```
This returned only 5 people (1 admin + 4 employees), excluding the manager.

### Dashboard Logic:
The dashboard was hardcoded to use 6 employees, which was technically correct for the total number of people in the system, but inconsistent with what other components were showing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the Employee Filter
Updated the filter in `data-service.js` line 378 to include managers:
```javascript
.filter(emp => emp.role === 'employee' || emp.role === 'admin' || emp.role === 'manager')
```

### 2. Verification Tools Created
- `verify-employee-count.html` - Comprehensive verification page
- Updated `test-data-consistency.html` to show roles

## Result
All system components now consistently show **6 employees**:
- ✅ Employee Management Page: 6 employees
- ✅ Dashboard Statistics: 6 employees  
- ✅ Analytics Data: 6 employees
- ✅ Payroll Calculations: 6 employees
- ✅ Attendance Tracking: 6 employees

## System Roles Breakdown
- **1 Admin:** John Administrator (System Administrator, IT Department)
- **1 Manager:** Maria Garcia (Operations Manager, Operations Department)
- **4 Employees:** 
  - David Chen (Senior Construction Worker, Construction Department)
  - Samantha Patel (Quality Control Specialist, Quality Assurance Department)
  - Robert Johnson (Equipment Operator, Operations Department)
  - Lisa Martinez (Safety Inspector, Safety Department)

## Files Modified
1. `js/data-service.js` - Updated getEmployees() filter to include managers
2. `verify-employee-count.html` - Created verification tool
3. `test-data-consistency.html` - Updated to show roles

The inconsistency has been resolved and all components now reflect the same employee count of 6.
