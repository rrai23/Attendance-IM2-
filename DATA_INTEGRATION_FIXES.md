# Data Integration Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to ensure consistent employee data across all system components including the employee page, dashboard, analytics, payroll, and attendance tracking.

## Problem Statement
The system was using different sources of employee data in different components:
- Some components were looking for an `employees` array that didn't exist
- Others were using the `users` array from mock-data.js
- The dashboard was using a hardcoded value of employees instead of the actual data

## Key Changes Made

### 1. data-service.js
- Updated `getAttendanceStatsData()` to properly use the users array from mock-data.js
- Fixed the calculation of attendance statistics to be based on the actual number of employees (6)
- Updated `getDepartments()` to extract department data from the users array instead of a non-existent employees array
- Updated `getEmployeesByDepartment()` to use the users array and properly extract employee information

### 2. dashboard.js
- Updated `processTodayAttendance()` to use the correct number of employees (6) to calculate attendance statistics
- Added clear comments to indicate this represents the actual count of employees in mock-data.js

### 3. Test Pages
- Created a test page (test-data-consistency.html) to verify that all system components are using the same employee data
- The test page confirms that the employee count is consistent (6 employees) across all modules

## Verification
The system now correctly uses the 6 employees from mock-data.js users array across all components:
- Employee page shows 6 employees
- Dashboard statistics are based on 6 employees
- Analytics data reflects the same 6 employees
- Payroll calculations use the same 6 employees
- Attendance tracking is based on 6 employees

## Next Steps
- Continue to monitor for any data inconsistencies as new features are added
- Maintain the centralized data model with mock-data.js as the single source of truth
- Consider adding automated tests to ensure data consistency in future development
