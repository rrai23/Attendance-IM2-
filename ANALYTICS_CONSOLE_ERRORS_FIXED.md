# Analytics Page Console Errors - FIXED

## üéØ Summary
Successfully resolved all console errors in the analytics page to ensure clean operation and proper integration with the unified data service.

## ‚ùå Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Chart.js Source Map Error**
**Error:** `Source map error: request failed with status 404 - chart.umd.min.js.map`

**Root Cause:** Chart.js CDN was using the latest version which had source map issues.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated Chart.js CDN link to use specific version with UMD distribution
- Changed from: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js`
- Changed to: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.js`

### 2. **Exports Reference Error**
**Error:** `Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined`

**Root Cause:** Date-fns library was expecting a Node.js environment with CommonJS exports.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed problematic date-fns import: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/date-fns@2.29.3/index.min.js`
- Created custom `window.dateUtils` object with browser-compatible date functions
- Provides: `format()`, `subDays()`, `addDays()`, `startOfWeek()`, `endOfWeek()`

### 3. **Missing chartsManager.resizeAllCharts Method**
**Error:** `Uncaught TypeError: chartsManager.resizeAllCharts is not a function`

**Root Cause:** The `ChartsManager` class was missing the `resizeAllCharts()` method that the analytics controller was trying to call.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `resizeAllCharts()` method to `ChartsManager` class in `js/charts.js`
- Enhanced analytics controller's `handleResize()` method with proper error handling
- Added fallback support for Chart.js instances

### 4. **Unused Preload Resource Warning**
**Error:** `The resource at "http://127.0.0.1:5500/js/data-service.js" preloaded with link preload was not used`

**Root Cause:** Analytics page was preloading a non-existent data-service.js file.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed unused preload link for `/js/data-service.js`
- Kept relevant preloads for `js/auth.js` and `js/theme.js`

## ‚úÖ Files Modified

- Updated Chart.js CDN link to specific version
- Removed date-fns import
- Added custom `window.dateUtils` object
- Removed unused preload resource
