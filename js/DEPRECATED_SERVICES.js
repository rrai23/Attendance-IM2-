üö® DEPRECATION NOTICE üö®

The following services have been REMOVED and replaced by DirectFlow:

‚ùå REMOVED (moved to js/DEPRECATED/):
- unified-data-service.js ‚Üí js/DEPRECATED/
- unified-employee-manager.js ‚Üí js/DEPRECATED/
- unified-employee-manager-auth-only.js ‚Üí js/DEPRECATED/
- unified-account-manager.js ‚Üí js/DEPRECATED/
- backend-api-service.js

‚úÖ REPLACEMENT:

üîÑ MIGRATION GUIDE:

OLD WAY (NO LONGER AVAILABLE):
window.dataService.getEmployees()
window.unifiedEmployeeManager.getAttendanceRecords()
window.unifiedAccountManager.authenticate()
window.backendApiService.syncToBackend()

NEW WAY:
window.directFlowAuth.apiRequest('/api/employees')
window.employeeController.loadAttendanceData()
window.directFlowAuth.authenticate()
DirectFlow backend API endpoints

üìã BENEFITS OF DIRECTFLOW:
- Pure backend communication (no localStorage)
- No mock data or fallbacks
- Streamlined API calls
- Better error handling
- Event-driven architecture
- Consistent data flow

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT:
- DirectFlow requires authentication
- No offline functionality
- Backend must be running
- All data is server-side only
