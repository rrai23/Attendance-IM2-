**✅ UNIFIED MANAGER REMOVAL COMPLETED**

All dependencies on UnifiedEmployeeManager and UnifiedAccountManager have been successfully removed from the attendance system.

## What Was Removed

### 🗂️ Moved to Deprecated Folder
- `js/unified-employee-manager.js`
- `js/unified-employee-manager-auth-only.js`  
- `js/unified-account-manager.js`
- `js/unified-data-service.js`

### 🧹 Cleaned Files
- `employee.html` - Removed UnifiedAccountManager initialization
- `js/auth.js` - Removed all unified manager method calls
- `js/analytics-old.js` - Updated to use DirectFlow authentication
- HTML test files - Commented out unified manager script includes

## What Replaced Them

### 🔐 Authentication
- **DirectFlow Authentication** (`js/directflow-auth.js`)
- **EmployeeController Security Methods** (in `js/employee.js`)

### 👥 Employee Management
- **Backend API Endpoints** (`/api/employees`, `/api/attendance`)
- **DirectFlow Backend Integration**

### 🔧 Account Management  
- **Backend API Routes** (`/api/accounts/:id`, `/api/accounts/:id/password`)
- **Proper Authentication with Bearer Tokens**

## Benefits

✅ **No localStorage Dependencies** - All data comes from backend
✅ **Proper Authentication** - DirectFlow JWT tokens
✅ **API Consistency** - Single source of truth (backend database)
✅ **Better Security** - No client-side credential storage
✅ **Simplified Architecture** - Direct backend communication

## Current System State

The attendance system now operates exclusively through:
- DirectFlow authentication for login/logout
- EmployeeController for employee dashboard functionality  
- Backend API endpoints for all data operations
- Proper JWT token authentication for all requests

**Result: Clean, secure, and simplified architecture! 🎉**
