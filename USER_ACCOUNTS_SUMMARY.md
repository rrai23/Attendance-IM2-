# USER ACCOUNTS AVAILABLE

## Authentication Issue Resolution

The authentication system has been fixed! The issue was in the backend authentication route where the database query result was being incorrectly processed.

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Database Query Result Processing**: The authentication route was expecting `result[0]` but the database was returning data directly as an array
2. **Frontend Token Storage**: Updated to store tokens using the correct localStorage keys
3. **Premature Logout**: Fixed by ensuring proper token storage and retrieval

## Available User Accounts

Based on the database analysis, these are the confirmed user accounts:

### 1. Admin Account

### 2. Employee Account

- **Password**: `admin123` (likely)
- **Role**: `employee`

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3000/login.html`
2. **Use credentials**: 
   - Username: `admin`

3. **After login**: You should be redirected to the dashboard without premature logout
