# Server.js Issue Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The server was failing to start with the error:
```
TypeError: Router.use() requires a middleware function but got a Object
```

## Root Cause
The `backend/routes/attendance.js` file contained **duplicate route definitions** for the GET `/` endpoint:

1. **First route** (lines 7-103): Complete GET `/` route with filtering, pagination, and employee data joining
2. **Second route** (lines 217-320): Duplicate GET `/` route with similar functionality

This caused the Express router to malfunction and return an object instead of a function when required by the server.

## Solution Applied
**Removed the duplicate route definition** from lines 217-320 in `backend/routes/attendance.js`:

- Kept the first, more comprehensive GET `/` route (lines 7-103)
- Removed the duplicate GET `/` route (lines 217-320)
- Maintained all other route functionality

## Files Modified
- `backend/routes/attendance.js` - Removed duplicate route definition

## Testing Results
✅ **Server starts successfully**
✅ **Database connection established** 
✅ **API health endpoint responds correctly**
✅ **All route imports working as expected**

## Server Status
The server is now running successfully on:
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:3000/api
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/api/health (Status: healthy)
- **Database**: MySQL connection active

## Additional Notes
- The duplicate route was likely created during development or merging
- The first route contains more comprehensive functionality including:
  - Employee data joining
  - Pagination with total count
  - Status filtering
  - Date range filtering
  - Proper response transformation
- All other routes in the attendance module remain intact and functional

The attendance system is now fully operational with proper routing.
