# Employee Wages Functionality Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed comprehensive employee wage management functionality across the Bricks Attendance System, including data service methods, UI components, currency formatting, and payroll calculations.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Data Service API Methods
**Problem**: Missing essential methods in `data-service.js`
**Solution**: Added the following methods:
- `getEmployees()` - Retrieve all employees with wage information
- `getEmployee(employeeId)` - Get single employee details
- `updateEmployeeWage(employeeId, newHourlyRate, notes)` - Update employee hourly rate
- `updateEmployee(employeeId, employeeData)` - Update employee information
- `addEmployee(employeeData)` - Add new employee
- `deleteEmployee(employeeId)` - Remove employee
- `calculatePayroll(employeeId, startDate, endDate)` - Calculate payroll for period
- `getOvertimeRequests()` - Get overtime requests
- `getPayrollHistory()` - Get payroll history
- `getSettings()` - Get system settings

### 2. Currency Formatting
**Problem**: `utils.formatCurrency()` not accessible globally
**Solution**: 
- Added `formatCurrency()` shortcut to main `Utils` object
- Created lowercase `utils` alias for compatibility
- Fixed currency formatting to use PHP (Philippine Peso) format

### 3. Employee Form Enhancement
**Problem**: Employee form only had salary field, no hourly rate support
**Solution**: Enhanced `employees.html` form to include:
- `hourlyRate` field for hourly wage (required)
- `salaryType` dropdown (hourly/salary)
- `salary` field for annual salary (auto-calculated for hourly workers)
- Automatic salary calculation based on hourly rate (40 hours/week × 52 weeks)

### 4. Employee Data Structure
**Problem**: Employee mock data missing wage-related fields
**Solution**: Updated employee data in `employees-page.js` to include:
- `hourlyRate` - Calculated from existing salary data
- `salaryType` - Set to 'hourly' for all employees
- Proper currency conversion for realistic hourly rates

### 5. Employee Management UI
**Problem**: View and edit modals not showing wage information properly
**Solution**: 
- Updated view modal to display hourly rate, salary type, and annual salary
- Enhanced form population to handle new wage fields
- Fixed form data collection to include wage-related fields
- Added currency formatting with PHP peso symbol (₱)

### 6. Payroll Integration
**Problem**: Payroll system not properly integrated with employee wage data
**Solution**: 
- Fixed payroll controller to load employees from data service
- Updated wage display formatting to use PHP currency
- Added fallback wage edit modal (simple prompt if advanced modal unavailable)
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### 7. Employee Form Validation & Auto-calculation
**Problem**: No automatic calculation of salary from hourly rate
**Solution**: Added JavaScript functionality to:
- Automatically calculate annual salary when hourly rate changes
- Update form behavior based on salary type selection
- Provide proper placeholders and validation
