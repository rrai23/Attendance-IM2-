# Employee Management Data Manager Initialization Fix

## Issue Identified
The employee management page was failing to initialize because it was looking for `window.dataManager` but the required script (`data-manager.js`) was not included in the HTML file.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Script**: The `data-manager.js` script was not included in the employee-management.html file
2. **Variable Name Mismatch**: The page expected `window.dataManager` but only `window.dataService` was available
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The initialization didn't provide clear diagnostics about what was missing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Script
**File**: `employee-management.html`
**Change**: Added `<script src="js/data-manager.js"></script>` to the script loading section

```html
<!-- Added data-manager.js script -->
<script src="js/data-manager.js"></script>
```

### 2. Enhanced Initialization Logic
**Improvements**:
- Extended wait time from 10 to 15 seconds
- Added checks for multiple possible data manager variables (`dataManager`, `dataService`, `unifiedEmployeeManager`)
- Added automatic aliasing if alternative managers are found
- Added detailed logging of available objects

### 3. Improved Error Diagnostics
**Features Added**:
- Detailed error messages showing available objects
- Technical details with stack traces
- Retry and navigation buttons
- Progressive logging every second while waiting

### 4. Enhanced Data Loading Methods
**Improvements**:
- Made data loading methods handle both async and sync APIs
- Added fallback to direct property access
- Better error handling with graceful degradation

### 5. Robust Event Listener Setup
**Changes**:
- Added checks for `addEventListener` method existence
- Graceful handling when event listeners aren't available
- Fallback to direct property access for data

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Successful Loading**: The page should now find `window.dataManager` created by `data-manager.js`
2. **Clear Diagnostics**: If there are still issues, the error message will show exactly what objects are available
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If the unified manager isn't available, the page will still attempt to provide basic functionality
4. **Better User Experience**: Users get actionable error messages with retry options

## Files Modified
- `employee-management.html`: Added script inclusion and enhanced initialization logic

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Fresh Load**: Clear browser cache and reload the page
2. **Check Console**: Monitor console for detailed initialization logs
3. **Verify Scripts**: Ensure all referenced JavaScript files are accessible
4. **Test Functionality**: Verify all CRUD operations work after successful initialization

## Prevention for Future
- Always include required scripts in dependency order
- Use consistent variable naming across the application
- Implement comprehensive error diagnostics
- Test initialization in isolation

The fix ensures the employee management page can properly initialize with the unified data service while providing clear feedback if issues persist.
